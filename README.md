> ## NOTE
<ul>
    <li>
        The first player(playerOne variable in code) is considered here to be white and the second player(playerTwo variable in code) is considered to be black.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether a player is Human or AI is controlled by the line no. 49 and 50 for playerOne and playerTwo respectively<br/>
        A player is Human if the boolean value of the variable said above is set to <code>True</code> and AI if it is set to <code>False</code>(Yes, this means we can enjoy an AI vs AI match by setting both variables to <code>False</code>)
